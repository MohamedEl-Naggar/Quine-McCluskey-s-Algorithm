Quine McCluskey's algorithm
The program should read the data from a text file which has the following example format:

3          // The first line should contain the number of variables which are limited to 16 variables.
1, 3, 6, 7 // The second line should contain all the minterms seperated by a comma.
0          // The third and last line should contain all the dont care values.
